I am a Ruby on Rails and Frontend developer from Pune, India. I mostly work on Ruby on Rails, React.js, GraphQL and I am currently learning TypeScript.

I am a Software Engineer at [AngelList](https://angel.co/india). Previously, I worked at [BigBinary](http://bigbinary.com/) as a Ruby on Rails and React Developer.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and I try to contribute to the open-source community. I have 70 plus open source contributions to [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails). These days I actively contribute to [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), [Rubocop-Minitest](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-minitest) and [Minitest-Style-Guides](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/minitest-style-guide).
